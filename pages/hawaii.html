    <h1 style="font-size: large">Hawaii (US):</h1>
    <p style="margin: 30px">
      Hawaii is a U.S. state that is an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. Of the
      eight major islands, Hawaii, Oʻahu, Maui, and Kauaʻi have major tourism
      industries, while it is limited on Molokai and Lānaʻi and access to Niihau
      and Kahoʻolawe is restricted. In 2017 alone, according to state government
      data, there were over 9.4 million visitors to the Hawaiian Islands with
      expenditures of over $16 billion.[1] Tourism makes up 21% of the state's
      economy, with many of Hawaii's largest industries revolving around the
      constant flow of tourists.[2] Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist
      travel is popular throughout the year. The summer months and major
      holidays are the most popular times for outsiders to visit, however,
      especially when residents of the rest of the United States are looking to
      escape from cold winter weather. The Japanese, with their economic and
      historical ties to Hawaii and the US as well as relative geographical
      proximity, make up the largest group of inbound international travelers to
      the islands, reaching 1,568,609 in 2017.[3] The average Japanese stays
      only 5 days while other Asians stay over 9.5 days and spend 25% more.[1]

      The Sustainable Tourism Association of Hawaii (formerly the Hawaii
      Ecotourism Association) was founded in 1995 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to
      nurture the development of sustainable tourism in Hawaii. It offers a
      certification program to educate and recognize conservation-minded tour
      operators in Hawaii, the only such certification program of its kind in
      America.[125] The long term environmental implications that Hawaii is
      facing due to mass tourism has raised concern. To combat this and help
      raise awareness, international environmental organizations have joined
      forces with local island communities. There are major benefits to this
      type of management, usually described as "values-led management".[126] By
      prioritizing the values and existing sustainable practices by local
      communities living on heavily visited islands, it preserves their
      interests and further respects their culture.

        <td>
          Waikiki, with its beautiful stretch of oceanfront beach, is Hawaii's
          biggest tourist attraction. A suburb of Honolulu, Waikiki is popular
          for its big resorts, dining, entertainment, and shopping. The Waikiki
          Historic Trail includes historic markers made of surfboards, inspired
          by Waikiki's own Duke Kahanamoku, an Olympic gold medalist swimmer and
          avid surfer. The boardwalk, known as the Waikiki Beach Walk, is lined
          with cafes and entertainment venues, while Kuhio and KalaKaua Avenues
          are where the bulk of the area's restaurants and boutiques can be
          found. Diamond Head State Monument sits at the end of the
          crescent-shaped beach, creating a distinctive profile on the
          coastline. It was once an important vantage point for the island's
          coastal defense, and a steep hike to the top brings you to the old
          bunkers and artillery control station and rewards your efforts with
          panoramic views.

          Pearl Harbor is a National Historic Landmark and active military base
          that earned its place in history for the 1941 attack, which killed
          1,177 servicemen on the USS Arizona. The site is now home to several
          attractions that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific
          Monument, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the
          remains of the sunken ship - parts of which can be seen protruding
          from the water. There is no cost for a tour of the memorial, however
          reservations are recommended due to its popularity. The Pearl Harbor
          Visitor Center has free admission and is the meeting place for tours,
          including transportation to the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford
          Island, where visitors can see WWII aircraft and artifacts, as well as
          experience landing an airplane on an aircraft carrier in a flight
          simulator. Other attractions include the USS Oklahoma, USS Utah, and
          the Battleship USS Missouri whose deck can be toured by visitors.

          Formed within the crater of a volcano on the island of Oahu, Hanauma
          Bay is a unique protected bay, which has been popular with snorkelers
          for a long time. After overuse caused pollution and damage to the
          delicate reef ecosystem, restoration efforts have restored the bay to
          its original splendor, and it is again open to visitors. The Hanauma
          Bay Education Center is a great place to learn about the bay, and
          there are several snorkeling rental shops that offer lessons, so that
          visitors can see the breathtaking reef system and its inhabitants
          up-close. At one time, feeding the tropical fish frozen peas was a
          touristy thing to do; this practice is no longer allowed. Also, to
          safeguard the area for future generations, all first-time visitors are
          required to watch a nine-minute video on marine life, safety rules,
          and preservation. Equipment rentals, including life jackets and
          snorkeling gear, are available at the kiosk in the park. Securing a
          spot in the pay parking lot can be tricky sometimes, as the 300-car
          lot fills up quickly in the winter. A per-person fee is charged to
          enter the park for those 12 years and older, although Hawaii residents
          get in for free.

          Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, Volcanoes National Park offers a
          unique, close-up look at an active volcano system where lava seeps
          from fissures in the earth. The surrounding landscape is shaped by
          cooled lava rock, both old and new, which has flowed over roads in a
          display of its unstoppable force. The park's centerpiece, Kilauea, has
          been active recently, including an eruption in January 2021 that
          formed a lava lake. Visitors should be aware that portions of the park
          are closed during periods of seismic activity that might pose a
          threat. The park has many things to do and see, including the Thurston
          Lava Tube, Devastation Trail, and the steaming Halema'uma'u crater.
          During the area's most active periods, tourists have the chance of
          experiencing the thrill of feeling seismic activity, hearing the boom
          of gas emissions, or even seeing a pillar of ash escaping into the
          air.

          mile wide at some points. This dramatic spectacle can be viewed best
          from the two main lookouts, Puu ka Pele and Puu hinahina. The canyon's
          landscape features rock strata in varying colors and several stunning
          waterfalls. Guided tours along the many challenging hiking trails and

          The Na Pali Coast State Wilderness Park on the island of Kauai
          contains some of the world's most dramatic landscapes. These were made
          famous in the film Jurassic Park, which shows a dramatic coastline
          with cliffs that seem to ripple and the "Wall of Tears" on Mount
          Waialeale, named for the way in which hundreds of waterfalls weep from
          the slopes of the mountain. Some of the best ways to take in the scene
          are to approach by water or to take a helicopter tour to view the
          simply breathtaking sight from above. Expert hikers can try the
          Kalalau Trail, an eleven-mile trek, which traverses five valleys and
          takes a full day each way.

          The dramatic Hana Road, officially named Hana Highway, is a scenic
          52-mile stretch of highway on the island of Maui that winds from Pāʻia
          through lush forests and along the coast to the remote town of Hana.
          This trip is worthwhile for the sightseeing along the stunning drive,
          the things to do along the way, and the visit to the town itself.
          Attractions along the route include numerous hiking trails,
          waterfalls, scenic overlooks, and beaches. Hana's location, relatively
          cut off from the rest of the island, has allowed it to maintain more
          of a traditional Hawaiian culture than other towns.
