    <p>
      <strong>Egypt</strong>, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates to
      the time of the pharaohs. Millennia-old monuments sit along the fertile
      Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids and Great Sphinx as
      well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and Valley of the Kings
      tombs. The capital, Cairo, is home to Ottoman landmarks like Muhammad Ali
      Mosque and the Egyptian Museum, a trove of antiquities.

    <h1>Top things to do in Egypt:</h1>
    <div id="main-div">
      <div>1. Pyramids of Giza:</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/giza.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>The last surviving of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the
        Pyramids of Giza are one of the world's most recognizable landmarks.
        Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs of the
        Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu), Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus (Menkaure),
        guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, are usually top of most visitor's
        lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first sight
        they head to after landing. Today, sitting on the desert edge of
        Cairo's sprawl, these megalithic memorials to dead pharaohs are still
        as wondrous a sight as they ever were and an undeniable highlight of
        any Egypt trip.</div>
      <div>2. Luxor's Karnak Temple and the Valley of the Kings</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/luxor-karnak-temple.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      <div>Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial
        Temple of Hatshepsut, the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a
        glut of tourist attractions. This is ancient Thebes, power base of the
        New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see on one
        visit. While Luxor's East Bank holds the modern city, with its vibrant
        souq; the two temples of Karnak and Luxor; and the museum; the West
        Bank's lush farmland and barren cliffs are where the vast majority of
        Luxor's tourist attractions sit, with so many tomb and temple sights
        that it has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world.
        Spend a few days here exploring the colorful wall art of the tombs and
        gazing in awe at the colossal columns in the temples, and you'll see
        why Luxor continues to fascinate historians and archaeologists.</div>
      <div>3. Cruising the Nile</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/Nile.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>Egypt is defined by the Nile. For many visitors, a multi-day cruise
        upon this famed waterway that saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a
        highlight of their Egypt trip. Cruising the Nile is also the most
        relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on
        the route between Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset over the
        date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's
        most tranquil vistas. The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the
        Temple of Kom Ombo and Edfu's Temple of Horus, where all the big
        cruise boats stop. If you'd prefer a less crowded and slower
        experience, though, and don't mind "roughing it" a bit, you can also
        cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt's traditional lateen-sailed wooden
        boats), which also allows you to create your own itinerary. The vast
        amount of cruise boat itineraries depart from either Luxor and Aswan,
        but feluccas can only be chartered for multi-day trips from Aswan.</div>
      <div>4. Aswan</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/aswan.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>Egypt's most tranquil town is Aswan, set upon the winding curves of
        the Nile. Backed by orange-hued dunes, this is the perfect place to
        stop and unwind for a few days and soak up the chilled-out atmosphere.
        Take the river ferry across to Elephantine Island and stroll the
        colorful streets of the Nubian villages. Ride a camel to the desert
        monastery of St. Simeon on the East Bank. Or just drink endless cups
        of tea on one of the riverboat restaurants, while watching the
        lateen-sailed feluccas drift past. Make sure to jump aboard a felucca
        at sunset to sail around Aswan's islands. This is by far, Aswan's most
        popular activity and the most relaxing way to take in the local
        sights. There are plenty of historic sites here and numerous temples
        nearby, including Philae Temple on its island, but one of Aswan's most
        popular things to do is simply kicking back and watching the river
        life go by.</div>
      <div>5. Abu Simbel</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/abu-simbel.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>Even in a country festooned with temples, Abu Simbel is something
        special. This is Ramses II's great temple, adorned with colossal
        statuary standing guard outside, and with an interior sumptuously
        decorated with wall paintings. Justly famous for its megalithic
        proportions, Abu Simbel is also known for the incredible engineering
        feat carried out by UNESCO in the 1960s, which saw the entire temple
        moved from its original setting to save it from disappearing under the
        rising water of the Aswan dam. Today, exploring Abu Simbel is just as
        much about admiring the triumph of this international effort to save
        the temple complex as it is about gaping in wonder at Ramses II's
        awe-inspiring building works, itself.</div>
      <div>6. Diving the Red Sea</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/red-sea.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>Below the Red Sea's surface is another world as fascinating as the
        temples and tombs on land. The coral reefs of the Red Sea are renowned
        among scuba divers for both the soft corals on display and the vast
        amount of sea life, ranging from colorful reef fish and nudibranchs,
        to sharks, dolphins, turtles, rays, and even dugongs. For divers, the
        most famous town to base yourself in is Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai
        Peninsula, closest to the reefs of Ras Mohammed National Park, as well
        as the reefs of the Straits of Tiran. To dive the sites of the Straits
        of Gubal head to Hurghada or El Gouna on the Red Sea coast, while
        advanced divers should check out the resort of Marsa Alam, the nearest
        base for diving Egypt's "deep south" dive sites.

        <br /><br />
        As well as fish life and coral, the Red Sea is a major wreck-diving
        destination. The most famous wreck is the Thistlegorm, a British WWII
        cargo ship that was on its way to resupply Allied troops when it was
        bombed by the Germans in 1941. Today the site is regarded by divers as
        one of the top five wreck dives in the world due to the vast cargo of
        cars, motorbikes, and WWII memorabilia that can be seen both scattered
        on the sea bed around the wreck and inside the ship itself. Dive boat
        trips to the wreck are organized from both Sharm el-Sheikh and
        Hurghada.</div>
      <div>7. Explore Islamic Cairo</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/islamic-cairo.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>The atmospheric, narrow lanes of the capital's Islamic Cairo district
        are crammed full of mosques, madrassas (Islamic schools of learning),
        and monuments dating from the Fatimid through to the Mameluke eras.
        This is where you'll find the labyrinth shopping souk of Khan
        el-Khalili, where coppersmiths and artisans still have their tiny
        workshops, and stalls are laden with ceramics, textiles, spice, and
        perfume. Surrounding the market is a muddle of roads, home to some of
        the most beautiful preserved architecture of the old Islamic empires.
        There is a wealth of history here to explore. Visit Al-Azhar Mosque
        and the dazzling Sultan Hassan Mosque, and make sure you climb to the
        roof of the ancient medieval gate of Bab Zuweila for the best
        minaret-speckled panoramas across the district.</div>
      <div>8. South Sinai's Beach Life</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/south-siani-beach.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>Egypt's South Sinai region, on the Sinai Peninsula, offers a beach for
        every type of traveler. Sharm el-Sheikh is a European-style resort
        town packed full of luxury hotels, international restaurants, and bags
        of entertainment options. A favorite with Europeans on winter-sun
        vacations, many of the resorts here cater to families on one- or
        two-week sun-and-sand breaks. Dahab is a low-key beach town with a
        budget-traveler heart, which is just as much about desert excursions
        and adventures as the sea. It's particularly known for its cheap
        dive-package deals and for its lagoon beach area where windsurfing and
        kitesurfing are the top activity. Up the coast, between the port town
        of Nuweiba and the border town of Taba, are the bamboo hut retreats
        that offer complete get-away-from-it-all respites from life and
        back-to-basics beach life.</div>
      <div>9. Saqqara</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/saqqara.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div>Everyone's heard of Giza's Pyramids, but they're not the only pyramids
        Egypt has up its sleeve. Day-tripping distance from Cairo, Saqqara is
        a vast necropolis of tombs and pyramids that was utilized during every
        era of pharaonic rule. It's best known for its Old Kingdom Step
        Pyramid, which shows how the architects of Ancient Egypt advanced
        their engineering knowledge to finally create a true pyramid shape.
        There's much more to see beyond the Step Pyramid, though, with some of
        the surrounding tombs, such as the Mastaba of Ti, showcasing some of
        the finest tomb paintings you'll see in the country. Nearby, the
        pyramid site of Dahshur is home to the Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid,
        which should be included on any Saqqara visit.</div>
      <div>10. Egyptian Museum</div>
      <div><img src="../assets/img/egyptian-museum.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <div>A treasure trove of the Pharaonic world, Cairo's Egyptian Museum is
        one of the world's great museum collections. The faded pink mansion in
        downtown Cairo is home to a dazzling amount of exhibits. It's a
        higgledy-piggledy place, with little labeling on offer and
        chronological order severely lacking, but that's half of its
        old-school charm. The museum's two highlight collections are the haul
        of golden treasures unearthed from Tutankhamen's tomb in the Valley of
        the Kings and the fascinating Royal Mummies exhibit room. Every corner
        you turn here, though, is home to some wonderful piece of ancient art
        or statuary that would form a highlight of any other museum.</div>
